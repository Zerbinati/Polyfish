## Overview
**Polyfish** is a UCI chess engine based on [Stockfish](https://github.com/official-stockfish). It is identical to Stockfish with the added capability of handling [Polyglot](https://web.archive.org/web/20191216195456/http://hardy.uhasselt.be/Toga/book_format.html) and [CTG](https://www.chessprogramming.org/CTG) book.

**Polyfish** supports two books at the same time, one could configure two CTG books, two BIN books, or one CTG and one BIN in either order. The second book is only probed if the first book has no moves for the given position. The engine starts searching only if no move is found in either the first book or the second book.

## UCI options

The following is a list of options supported by Polyfish (on top of all UCI options supported by Stockfish)
  * #### CTG/BIN Book 1 File
    The file name of the first book file which could be a polyglot (BIN) or Chessbase (CTG) book. To disable this book, use: ```<empty>```
    If the book (CTG or BIN) is in a different directory than the engine executable, then configure the full path of the book file, example:
    ```C:\Path\To\My\Book.ctg``` or ```/home/username/path/to/book/bin```

  * #### Book 1 Width
    The number of moves to consider from the book for the same position. To play best book move, set this option to ```1```. If a value ```n``` (greater than ```1```) is configured, the engine will pick **randomly** one of the top ```n``` moves available in the book for the given position

  * #### Book 1 Depth
    The maximum number of moves to play from the book
	
  * #### (CTG) Book 1 Only Green
    This option is only used if the loaded book is a CTG book. When set to ```true```, the engine will only play Green moves from the book (if any). If no green moves found, then no book move is made
	This option has no effect or use if the loaded book is a Polyglot (BIN) book
    
  * #### CTG/BIN Book 2 File
    Same explanation as **CTG/BIN Book 1 File**, but for the second book

  * #### Book 2 Width
    Same explanation as **Book 1 Width**, but for the second book

  * #### Book 2 Depth
    Same explanation as **Book 1 Depth**, but for the second book

  * #### (CTG) Book 2 Only Green
    Same explanation as **(CTG) Book 1 Only Green**, but for the second book


## UCI commands
Polyfish supports all UCI commands supported by Stockfish. *Click [here](https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish/wiki/UCI-&-Commands) to see the full list of supported Stockfish UCI commands*

Polyfish also supports the following UCI commands

  * #### book
    This command causes the engine to show available moves and associated information from the currently configured books

## Note about CTG books:
<ins>**C**</ins>hessBase Opening <ins>**T**</ins>ree of <ins>**G**</ins>ames (CTG), is the natibe book format used by all ChessBase products. The specification is not made available to the public from Chessbase. Instead, **Polyfish** relied on the following public resources:
* [CTG Specifications](https://web.archive.org/web/20210129162445/https://rybkaforum.net/cgi-bin/rybkaforum/topic_show.pl?tid=2319)
* [remoteglot](https://github.com/madnight/remoteglot)
* [jja](https://git.sr.ht/~alip/jja)
* [ctgexporter](https://github.com/sshivaji/ctgexporter)

The reverse engineered specs are good enough to proble the book for moves, but it does not provide the same functionality as Chessbase own products. The following is a list of known limitations of **Polyfish**'s CTG book implementation:
- Does not support underpromotion, which means all promotion moves are assumed to be to a Queen
- Does not support more than two Queens on the board
- The logic that determines Green/Red moves is not 100% accurate which may cause the engine not to play certain Green moves because it cannot identify them.
- Some move annotations and engine recommendations can be read.

The move weight calculated by **Polyfish** (can be seen using the **book** command) is my own attempt to compensate for all the missing/unknown information about the CTG specification. Using the calculated weight, **Polyfish** can pick the best move for a given position in 99% of the times because it ustilizes existing move statistics such as number of wins, draws, and losses, as well as "known" annotations (!, !?, ?!, ??, OnlyMove, etc...) and recommendations (Green vs. Red) if available.

Despite the fact that Polyfish can read and play from CTG Book, it is not going to be identical to Chessbase own products since it is based on the partial CTG specification available publicly. Use at your own risk!

## Questions and Answers

- **<ins>How do I force my CTG book to play only Green moves?</ins>**<br/>
You can force the engine to only pick and play Green moves from your configured CTG book by enabling the option ```(CTG) Book 1 Only Green``` or ```(CTG) Book 2 Only Green``` (enabled by default)
<br/><br/>

- **<ins>If my CTG book has more than one Green move for a given position, which move will be played?</ins>**<br/>
The move selection from CTG books and BIN books depends on the attributes (properties and statistics) associated with the moves in question. Such attributes are the WDL game count (Win, Draw, and Loss) as well as move recommendations (Green or Red) and commentary (!, !!, !?, ?, ?!, ??, only move, Zugzwang) which are stored in the CTG book (note that BIN books only have number of games without WDL statistics, recommendations, commentary, or annotations).
<br/><br/>Polyfish uses all available move attributes depending on the book type to calculate a **Weight** which indicates how good or bad the move is. The higher the weight, the better the move.
<br/><br/>After calculating move weights, the engine selects one of the top **N** moves randomly. The value of **N** can be configured using the UCI option ```Book 1 Width``` and ```Book 2 Width```
<br/><br/>

- **<ins>How do I make the engine play the best Green move available?</ins>**<br/>
Configure the ```Book 1 Width``` (or ```Book 2 Width```) to the value **1** and make sure to enable the option ```(CTG) Book 1 Only Green``` (or ```(CTG) Book 2 Only Green```)
<br/><br/>

- **<ins>What move will be played if my CTG book has no Green moves for a given position?</ins>**<br/>
If no Green moves are found in the configured CTG book,  then engine will check the value of the UCI option ```(CTG) Book 1 Only Green``` (or ```(CTG) Book 2 Only Green```) in order to decide if it is allowed to play a non Green move. If not allowed then no move is played and the next book is checked, if configured, or the engine will start thinking.
<br/><br/>If it is allowed to play a non Green move, then the engine will calculate the weights of available moves (as described earlier) and play one of the top weight moves depending the configured value of ```Book 1 Width``` or (```Book 2 Width```)
<br/><br/>

- **<ins>What effect does the options ```(CTG) Book 1 Only Green``` and ```(CTG) Book 2 Only Green``` have on my Polyglot (BIN) book?</ins>**<br/>
The options ```(CTG) Book 1 Only Green``` and ```(CTG) Book 2 Only Green``` do not have any effect on BIN books so it does not matter if they are checked (true) or unchecked (false). Use these two options only for CTG books
